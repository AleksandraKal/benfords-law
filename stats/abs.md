1. Scrapes the annual population change, this measures --
Intresting results:
- obtains the general shape, with a lograthmic curve downard sloping
- almost 50% of data is skewed being the digit "1"


2. Birth registered: counts the total amount of births
Intresting results:
- doesnt obtain the same shape
- the most popular digit is 2!
- no leading digits of the numbers 4-9 (which makes sense, thus maybe shouldnt have used this data as there is a min and max)
